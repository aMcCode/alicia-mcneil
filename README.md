### This is definitely a work in progress. A good first attempt at mobile first/responsive design. The nav menu and mobile to desktop transition is a bit quirky and not completely implemented as I'd like, but I'm pleased I was able to make it work with this first attempt. I've learned quite a bit as I worked on the design and have learned about some tools I didn't have time implement. Here are some things to work on:


#### * Improving initial CSS so fewer media queries are needed
#### * Streamlining media queries (some instructions don't need to be repeated)
#### * Update initial CSS to set max widths and min heights more strategically.
#### * Explore using function clamp() to improve text resizing
#### * Update image files w/in paint or something so they aren't so large and are maybe easier to manage in the html.
